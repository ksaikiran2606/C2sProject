# ✅ Browser Issue Fixed!

## What Was Wrong
- Frontend server wasn't running (connection refused)
- Backend server wasn't running

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Started Backend Server** in a new terminal window
   - Running at: http://localhost:8000
   - Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin

2. **Started Frontend Server** in a new terminal window  
   - Running at: http://localhost:8081
   - Web version for browser

3. **Opened Browser** automatically

## 🌐 Access Your App

**Frontend (App):**
- URL: http://localhost:8081
- Should open automatically in browser

**Backend (API):**
- URL: http://localhost:8000
- Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin (admin/admin123)

## 📝 What You Should See

### In Browser:
1. **First time:** May take 30-60 seconds to compile
2. **You'll see:** "Compiling..." or loading screen
3. **Then:** The marketplace app login/register screen

### In Terminal Windows:
You should see **TWO terminal windows**:

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```
Metro waiting on exp://...
Web is waiting on http://localhost:8081
```

## ⏳ If App Doesn't Load Immediately

**Wait 30-60 seconds** for first compilation, then:
1. Refresh the browser (F5)
2. Or visit: http://localhost:8081

## ✅ Everything Should Work Now!

- ✅ Backend running
- ✅ Frontend running  
- ✅ Browser opened
- ✅ App loading

**Check your browser - the app should be loading!** 🎉
